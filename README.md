This is an authentification system.
If you are a beginner in node.js and you want to challenge yourself in your learning session, this system is there for you.
In this system, we used:
node.js/express for backend,
ejs for tamplating,
cookie-parser for storing authentificated user's information (id, name, etc...) that is then shared in all the pages
